# Encryption-and-Decryption

#The program main idea is to deal with encryption and decrytion

#The main step formula which is used encrypt the text

# This is used to find the new char ## (A + B) % 26 ## where 26 is the total number alphabets
# This is used to find the new digit ## (int(A) + B) % 10 ## 

#The main step formula which is used decrypt the text

# This is used to find the new char ## (A - B) % 26 ## where 26 is the total number alphabets


#functions used in this program are:

# def       -- it is the dirving code
# isupper() -- it is used to check whether the given text is in uppercase
# islower() -- it is used to check whether the given text is in lowercase
# isdigit() -- it is used to check whether the given text contain digits
# ord()     -- used to return the ASCII value of the given charater eg-- ord("A") = 65
# chr()     -- used to return the value ASCII charater eg -- chr(65) = A
